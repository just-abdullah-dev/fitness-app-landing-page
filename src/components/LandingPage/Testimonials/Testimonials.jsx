      "I had a hard time keeping track of my workout routine. Writing them down was a chore and I didn't want to be doing it while I'm working out. Glad I can set up my workout routines with just a tap and I love that it keeps track of my stats as well.",

      "I really love this app! It helps me plan and keep track of all my workouts. It also keeps track of my reps and weight, which makes it easier for me to increase it overtime. It's also nice to be able to see other peoples workouts and share your workouts with friends!",

    title: "Best Workout Tracker",
    comment:
      "Used other workout trackers but this one is the absolute best. Very easy to plug in your program routines and start hitting the weights. Also has the unique social aspect which I was skeptical at first but now LOVE it since I can share exactly my workouts that day with just a link to anyone. 100% go with Hevy.",
